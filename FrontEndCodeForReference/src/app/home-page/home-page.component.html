                            This Application is intended to be used by a Non-Profit Charitable Organization to manage their Diet Programs that they offer/execute for the public solely based on referral system. 
                            You need to have a referral code for registering for the program.

                            It provides three types of users such as: Program Administrator, Motivator and Challenger.

                            Below you get a overview of the entire application.

                            Each year there will be four quarterly batches which would further be divided into groups based on appropriate criteria. 
                            Once a challenger registers for this program, the program administrator would review the registration and based on the details of the challenger, approve/reject the registration giving proper reason.
                            If registration is successful, the program administrator would allocate a batch/group and then the challenger needs to follow the plan and update progress.
                            Each group will also have 1-5 motivators assigned who are previous challengers and would now conntribute by motivating new challengers.
                            Once the current batch is over, the challenger can register again for the next batch.
                            All the users of this application could also message each other through the application and be in contact.

                            The Application handles all authentications and authorization of all the above 3 types of users. Based on the “Role” of the user (i.e., Program Administrator, Motivator or Challenger) appropriate screens, dashboards, reports and options are made available.

                    Challengers are users who have registered for this diet program and are part of a batch. 
                    They are expected to follow the instructions of the diet program strictly on a day to day basis and will be expected to update daily logs on status of the daily tasks/plan assigned to them and other related activities like updating the monthly measurement chart and a one-time medical history chart. 
                    Once the batch is over, they can register again for the next batch by updating their details and continue their fitness journey or they could also choose to become a motivator for the new challengers.
